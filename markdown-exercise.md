### HOW TO MAKE A CARAMEL MACCHIATTO
1.  Steam the Milk â€“ Heat the milk in a saucepan or use a milk frother to create a smooth, foamy texture.
2.  Add Vanilla Syrup â€“ Pour the vanilla syrup into a mug.
3.  Pour in Steamed Milk â€“ Slowly add the steamed milk into the mug, leaving some room at the top.
4. Brew and Add Espresso â€“ Brew a fresh shot of espresso and pour it over the milk (this creates the "macchiato" effect, meaning "stained" in Italian).
5.  Drizzle with Caramel â€“ Generously drizzle caramel sauce on top in a crosshatch pattern.
6.  Enjoy! â€“ Stir if you prefer an even mix or sip as is for the layered effect.
